## üöÄ Overview

The **Power BI Calendar** provides a flexible and extensible foundation for **Date, SlicerDate, and Fiscal Time Intelligence** modeling in **Power BI** and **Microsoft Fabric**.
 It‚Äôs designed to be an *example and reusable template* that you can easily tailor to your organization‚Äôs unique calendar, fiscal, or reporting requirements.

This project demonstrates how to build a configurable and future-proof time dimension framework entirely within Power BI Projects (`.pbip`), leveraging **Power Query (M)**, **DAX**, and **TMDL** definitions.

------

## üß≠ Key Features

‚úÖ **Supports multiple calendar frameworks:**

- Gregorian / Standard Calendar
- Fiscal (custom year-ends)
- ISO 8601 Weeks
- Retail (4-4-5 structure)
- 13-Month Cycles
- Lunar Calendars
- JD Edwards integration (Julian dates)

‚úÖ **Includes pre-built components:**

- Configurable **Date** table (Power Query M-script)
- Dynamic **SlicerDate** table for calendar switching
- **Fiscal Time Intelligence** calculation group
- Full **TMDL model definitions** for integration into `.pbip` projects
- Example of **Role-Playing Dimensions** (Order Date, Ship Date, etc.)

‚úÖ **Ready for enterprise use:**

- Works seamlessly in Power BI Desktop and Microsoft Fabric
- Version-controlled semantic model definitions
- Extensible via **User Defined Functions (UDFs)** and custom measures

------

## üß© Files Provided

- `Date.tmdl`
- `SlicerDate.tmdl`
- `FiscalTimeIntelligence.tmdl`
- `Calendar.pbip` (example project)
- `/Config/` ‚Äì Power Query scripts

TMDL files can be found in:

```
..\Semanticise-Calendar.SemanticModel\TMDLScripts
```

Or open directly in Power BI Desktop using the **TMDL View** (left margin).

1. ## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

   1. **Clone or download the repository:**

      ```
      git clone https://github.com/OlapOffice/Calendar.git
      ```

   2. **Open the project:**
       Launch `Calendar.pbip` in **Power BI Desktop** (or Fabric workspace) to explore the model and visuals.

   3. **Review the configuration:**
       In **Power Query**, open the `Date` query and adjust the configuration section to define:

      - Start and end dates
      - Fiscal year-end month
      - Optional retail or lunar calendars

   4. **Use the Calendar Template page:**

      - The included **‚ÄúPage Calendar Template‚Äù** report page serves as a *starting point* for building new analytics views.
      - To create a new report page, **duplicate this template** and adapt it for your specific use case ‚Äî for example, Sales, Financials, or Operations.
      - The **Calendar visuals, slicers, and measures** can be easily tailored to display the relevant **Calendar, Fiscal, or ISO** views based on the slicer selection.

   5. **Integrate into your solution:**

      - Copy the `.tmdl` files from

        ```
        ..\Semanticise-Calendar.SemanticModel\TMDLScripts
        ```

        into your Power BI Project or Fabric Semantic Model folder.

      - Open Power BI Desktop and enable the **TMDL View** to confirm the imported Date, SlicerDate, DateRolePlaying, and FiscalTimeIntelligence definitions.

      - Mark `Date` as the official Date Table, validate relationships, and refresh.

   6. **Customize further:**

      - Extend the model by adding your organization‚Äôs **custom fiscal logic**, **UDFs**, or **time-based KPIs**.
      - Optionally, integrate the Calendar framework into an existing semantic model to ensure alignment across datasets.
